          Smart calculate: Your current % of contributions distribution is used
          to generate a weighted plan. This plan would align with your current
          contribution activity trends. The difference to goal is multiplied by
          the %, and the date/frequency is taken into account to get your plan.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          {" "}
          Manual calculate: You would select which categories you want to
          contribute to. Each selected category is then given an equal % weight,
          and the difference to goal is multiplied by those equal %, and the
          date/frequency is taken into account to get your plan.{" "}
