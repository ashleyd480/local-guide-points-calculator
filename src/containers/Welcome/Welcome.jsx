              </p>
              <p> This calculator allows you to come up with a plan to achieve your points goal by a certain date.With this calculator, you can either have a plan:  </p>
    
        <ul>
          <li> Smart calculated: Your current % of contributions distribution is used to generate a weighted plan. This plan would align with your current contribution activity trends. The difference to goal is multiplied by the %,  and the date/frequency is taken into account to get your plan. </li>
          <li> Manual calculated: You would select which categories you want to contribute to. Each selected category is then given an equal % weight, and the difference to goal is multiplied by those equal %, and the date/frequency is taken into account to get your plan.   </li>
