            Smart calculated: Your current % of contributions distribution is
            used to generate a weighted plan. This plan would align with your
            current contribution activity trends. The difference to goal is
            multiplied by the %, and the date/frequency is taken into account to
            get your plan.{" "}

            Manual calculated: You would select which categories you want to
            contribute to. Each selected category is then given an equal %
            weight, and the difference to goal is multiplied by those equal %,
            and the date/frequency is taken into account to get your plan.{" "}
